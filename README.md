- Hi, I’m Joel Ong, a final year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Science, Pharmacy at the National University of Singapore
- I’m interested in exploring how the adoption of tech can benefit the healthcare, pharmaceutical and medtech industry
- I spend most of my time tinkering with python and its associated libraries to perform data analysis on large datasets 
- I would love to collaborate on any projects within the healthcare, pharmaceutical and medtech space
